# Grocery list
### Requirements
The application need to have teh following features:
* View the paged grocery items list
*	Specify the unit price for each item
*	If the user marks an item as purchased the total cost must be updated 

### Application architecture
* Client app : Angular 5
* Server app : REST APIs using NodeJs

To speed things up we've created a mocking end-points to retrieve the data
 > http://demo5758209.mockable.io/api/v1/groceries?limit=3&page=[value]
 > 
 > use the `page` query string parameter to navigate through pages (1 <= [value] <= 3)

 ### Evaluation criteria
 Your output work would be evaluated against the following criteria: -
* App architecture and conformance to best practices on developing clean code, performance
* case handling
* developer notes and comments
* UI
